<h1> FlokiBonk Token </h1>
<p>FlokiBonk is a community-owned project on the Binance Smart Chain. Created by a group of meme-enjoying dog lovers, $FLOBO seeks to create a purely community-driven token with auto-staking and liquidity generation protocols built into the contract. Ownership was renounced and liquidity burned forever at launch, resulting in a permanently locked, decentralized cryptoasset that can be freely traded by any user with BNB. Each transaction is taxed at 10%, with half of this amount going to liquidity, and the other being distributed amongst all holders proportionally. Didn't get in Floki? $FLOBO is taking everyone's favorite new dog to the next level of memes.</p>
